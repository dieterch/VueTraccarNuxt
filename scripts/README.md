```

## Data Structures

### Travel Patches

The export-travel-patches script works with the `travel_patches` table which has the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `address_key` | TEXT | Unique identifier for the address (location) |
| `title` | TEXT | Custom title/description for the travel |
| `from_date` | TEXT | Start date filter (ISO format) |
| `to_date` | TEXT | End date filter (ISO format) |
| `exclude` | INTEGER | Whether to exclude this location (1 = true, 0 = false) |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of creation |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of last update |

**Note:** The export format matches the structure of `data/travels.yml` and can be used as a reference or backup.

### Timing Adjustments

The timing scripts work with the `standstill_adjustments` table which has the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `standstill_key` | TEXT | Unique identifier for the standstill period |
| `start_adjustment_minutes` | INTEGER | Minutes to adjust start time (negative = earlier, positive = later) |
| `end_adjustment_minutes` | INTEGER | Minutes to adjust end time (negative = earlier, positive = later) |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of creation |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of last update |

### Manual POIs

The manual POI scripts work with the `manual_pois` table which has the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `poi_key` | TEXT | Unique identifier for the POI (e.g., "manual_poi_12345") |
| `latitude` | REAL | Latitude coordinate of the POI |
| `longitude` | REAL | Longitude coordinate of the POI |
| `timestamp` | TEXT | ISO timestamp when the POI was created/recorded |
| `device_id` | INTEGER | Device ID associated with the POI |
| `address` | TEXT | Full address of the POI location |
| `country` | TEXT | Country where the POI is located |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of creation |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of last update |

**Note:** Manual POIs are independent points of interest created by users (e.g., via Cmd/Ctrl+Click on the map) and are not associated with device trips.

## Merge vs Replace Mode

### Merge Mode (Default)
- Keeps existing records that aren't in the import file
- Updates existing records if the key matches (`standstill_key`, `address_key`, or `poi_key`)
- Adds new records from the import file
- **Use when:** You want to add/update specific records without losing others

### Replace Mode (`--replace`)
- Deletes ALL existing records first
- Then imports all records from the file
- **Use when:** You want to completely replace all data with the imported set

## Notes

- The database path is automatically set to `data/app.db` relative to the project root
- Import operations use transactions to ensure data consistency
- The `--dry-run` option is useful for previewing changes before committing them
- Timestamps are preserved during export/import when available
- The `updated_at` field is always set to the current time during import

## Requirements

- Node.cjs (version 14 or higher)
- better-sqlite3 package (already included in project dependencies)

## Troubleshooting

**Database not found:**
- Ensure you're running the scripts from the project root or scripts directory
- Check that the database exists at `data/app.db`

**Invalid file format:**
- Ensure JSON files have the correct structure (with `adjustments` or `pois` array as appropriate)
- Ensure YML files follow the expected format for travel patches
- Use the corresponding export script to create properly formatted files

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure you have read/write permissions for the database file
- Ensure you have write permissions for the output directory
